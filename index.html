      <p>My mother and father come from Vietnam and they both speak Vietnamese and Cantonese, as do I however I am not
        very fluent in any of those languages. I have just recently graduated high school and I am currently studying my
        first year of Bachelor of IT at RMIT University. During my spare time, I enjoy playing games with my friends. I
        recently started playing Genshin Impact which is an action role-playing game. I also recently got back into
        Valorant which is a 5v5 FPS game. In the past, I played games like Dota 2 and CSGO.

    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that
        sparked your interest?</b></p>
    Ever since I was young I had always had an interest in IT. It was something that I grew up around. My cousins were
    the
    ones who inspired and introduced me to computers and IT in general. Where I used to watch my cousins play CS: Source
    and Dota on their computers and get to play with them occasionally as well as watch them build and work on their
    websites. I eventually gained an interest in PCs in 2017 where I would eventually buy and build my own. 2017 was
    also
    the year where my knowledge of IT and computers grew most and was also the year that I decided that I wanted to
    pursue
    a career in IT when I was older. Although my cousins were the ones who inspired and introduced me to IT they weren’t
    the ones who sparked my interest in IT, it was UNI, the first few weeks of my course was where I found myself
    genuinely drawn and interested, whether it was learning Python for the first time or improving my HTML skills all of
    these events led me to enjoy IT even more. So if I was asked what particular event sparked my interest in IT my
    answer
    would be my first few weeks of UNI.
    <p><b>Outline your IT experience</b></p>
    Before starting UNI I had a little bit of experience in HTML from high school where I had taken an Introduction to
    Computing class, besides that, I didn’t have any experience. However, since I started UNI I recently started to
    learn
    Python and as well as learn more HTML.
    <p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
    At first, I had decided to choose RMIT because of its location, however, I wanted to be sure that RMIT was the
    university that I wanted to attend so I did more research and found that it was ranked highly as a university for IT
    as well as being a University that offered a wide range of facilities and equipment as well as highly qualified
    staff
    that would be there whenever I needed. Furthermore, I had many recommendations to go to RMIT from my cousins as they
    also attended RMIT where they vouched that it was an extremely good university for experiences and professionalism.

    <p><b> A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to
        you.
    </p></b>
    The role of a Network Engineer primarily revolves around the management of an organization's computer networks as
    well
    as the setup and development of those networks. Furthermore, Networks Engineers will also provide assistance to
    employees as well as clientele of the business if a problem arises. In relation to solving problems that may arise
    in
    the future, Network Engineers will continuously monitor the networks and resolve problems in areas such as a
    business’s VPN/NETWORK, and resolve issues that may arise from the firewall logs.
    <p><b>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position. </p>
    </b>
    The skills that I believe are required to a Network Engineer include the ability to keep up to date with an
    organization's technical needs and industry demands, exceptional communication skills that will allow the individual
    to communicate effectively with untrained staff, the ability to be able to take on various tasks and pay attention
    to
    detail, excellent analytical and problem-solving abilities and the ability to work in teams as well as with clients
    of
    the organization. Furthermore, the qualifications and experience needed to become a Network Engineer would include
    the
    following, experience as a Network Engineer at a company, relevant certifications such as ‘Cisco Certified Network
    Associate’ or ‘Cisco Certified Network Professional’ and a Bachelor degree in Information Technology.
    <p><b> A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have. </p></b>
    As of now I currently believe that I have the ability to take on various tasks and pay close attention to all of
    them,
    and the ability to communicate and convey what I want to individuals who don’t have any experience within a
    particular
    field. Regarding qualifications and experience to become a Network Engineer I don't have any certifications or the
    experience however I plan to acquire the skills and qualifications necessary to pursue my career choice.
    <p><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position,
        building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over
        time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</p></b>
    The ways I plan on obtaining the necessary certifications to pursue my career goal is to take part in ‘Cisco
    Certified
    Network Associate’ course as well as enroll in a ‘Cisco Certified Network Professional’ course to further develop
    the
    necessary skills needed to become a Network Engineer and establish a strong foundation on Networking. I also intend
    to
    acquire work experience by applying for a Junior Network Engineer position after the completion of my Bachelor. To
    develop my skills I plan to attend Networking events and speak to professionals in the field asking for advice which
    will help greatly in improving my communication skills, as well as my knowledge in the field.

      </div>

      <p><b> What do the results of these tests mean for you?. </p></b>
      In relation to the ‘Myers - Briggs test’, I find the results to be accurate and detailed out of the three tests. I
      believe that the test not only portrays how an individual acts when they encounter problems but also how they act
      and hold themselves within society itself, as a person who isn't very emotional and who is mostly independent I
      find
      the results of the test true to my character. Moreover, I find the results from the ‘Online Learning Test’ to be
      extremely limited and inefficient as It only applies to specific groups of individuals, for example, the question
      ‘What kind of books do you like to read for fun?’ as a person who doesn’t read books I tend to watch videos
      instead.
      However, I do find the test to be beneficial from an educational standpoint especially to teachers who wish to
      adapt
      and change their teaching style to accommodate students within their class. I believe that the results from the
      ‘Five Big Personality Test’ are accurate but I believe that it can be improved as some of the questions asked are
      dependent on a person and not applicable to them. For example, the results of this test show that I am an
      extrovert
      however I am the complete opposite of this.
      <p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </p></b>
      In terms of how these results may reflect in the team, I believe that there are pros and cons, pros being that it
      may help the team to be more productive if there are individuals who are independent as they can take the
      initiative
      in completing the set tasks. However, the cons being, individuals who rely mostly on their skills may lack in
      communicating with their team members which may be counterproductive instead.
      <p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team</p></b>
      I believe that results from these types of tests can be used to help form a team and that it would help boost a
      team’s productivity if teams were grouped together based on their personalities and learning styles. However, I
      doubt the effectiveness of doing this as it may result in conflict within the team if multiple personalities are
      being grouped together.

      <h2>Project Idea</h2>
      <p><b> Overview of Project </p></b>
      I plan on developing a ‘Calorie Tracker’ app that will allow users to efficiently track the amount of calories
      that
      they eat. The application will offer users a clean easy to navigate design, Furthermore, the application will
      allow
      users to scan the barcode of items, where the system will then automatically add the item to the foods that they
      have eaten for the day along with a summary of the amount of calories an individual has consumed, their protein
      intake, carbohydrates intake as well as their fat intake.
      <p><b> Motivation for Project </p></b>
      My motivation for designing a ‘Calorie Tracker’ app is to allow individuals like myself who wish to keep count of
      their daily intake a quick and efficient way to do so, especially with the option of scanning the barcode of the
      item. As an individual who keeps track of my daily intake I tend to write down what I eat in a day on my phone,
      which can be at times annoying. This app will be useful for individuals who do track their calorie intake and want
      a
      method which is quick and easy. Nowadays, most calorie counting apps make customers enter the dietary information
      of
      the item manually which is extremely tedious.
      <p><b> Description of Features and Services </p></b>
      The ‘Calorie Tracker’ app significantly aids users who wish to lose weight, build muscle as well as become more
      fit,
      through an easy and efficient system that allows users to track what they are eating in a day.
      <b><br>General Information</b></br>
      <li>The ‘Calorie Tracker’ app will be available to users aged 10+</li>
      <li>Be available on both IOS and Android</li>
      <li>The app will be free of charge</li>
      <li>For first time users, there will be a registration allowing to create an account in case a user decides to
        transfer to a different device. Furthermore, a tutorial will follow to which will show users how to navigate
        through the different parts of the app and how to add foods using the barcode scanner</li>
      <b><br>Nutrition and Dieting</b></br>
      <li>The app has a extremely large food library which will allow users to use the barcode scanner within the app
        which can be located at the top right of the screen, enabling users the ability log foods through a quick and
        efficient manner</li>
      <li>Daily intake tracker, which will automatically assort the nutrients of all foods onto the main screen allowing
        users to see their current protein intake, carbohydrates intake, fat intake and overall calorie intake for the
        day.</li>
      <li>Calorie Deficit, the app will enable users the ability to fully customise there calorie deficit (maximum
        calories) to accommodate the users diet plan or calorie goal.</li>
      <li>During the end of the week there will be a summary page allowing users to see their overall intake of the week
        as well as showing how many days of the week they went without exceeding their calorie limit.</li>
      <b><br>Support and Help</b></br>
      <li>There will be a dedicated ‘Support and Help’ tab within the app which will provide an email and contact number
        for users experiencing troubles with the app followed by an estimated response time.</li>
      <li>The ‘Support and Help’ tab will provide users with a FAQ page for quick solutions for common issues users may
        encounter</li>
      <b><br>Design</b></br>
      <li>The ‘Calorie Tracker’ will provide users with a personalization feature allowing users to change the theme of
        their app in specific a ‘Dark’ or ‘Light’ mode will be available which will help users with visibility depending
        on the environment they are in.</li>
      <li>On the main screen of the app there will be an overall summary of a person intake for the day displaying on
        the
        top of the screen</li>
      <b><br>Community and Friends</b></br>
      <li>The ‘Calorie Tracker’ will allows user to export their daily intake of the day as a photo if users wish to
        track
        their progress throughout their weight loss journey</li>

      <p><b> Tools and Technologies </p></b>
      The software I intend to use to build my application include MIT App Inventor which is a development environment
      that can be used to create applications for Android. Furthermore, another software that I intend to use for the
      creation of my application would be AppCode which supports several languages that i am familiar with such as CSS,
      HTML and Python. Furthermore, cross platform app developments such as ‘React Native’ that will allow the
      application
      to launch on IOS, Android and WIndows. Other hardware that is necessary for the development of this application
      would be a personal computer/ laptop to work on the application. Additionally, users who can test out the
      application and provide feedback would be extremely helpful in building a design that is efficient and quick.
      <p><b> Skills Required </p></b>
      In relation to the skill set required for this project project it includes the knowledge and understanding of
      programming languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS that will be used to develop the application. Moreover, other
      important skills that are necessary include experience with cross-platform app development programs, excellent
      time
      management skills, as well as excellent analytical skills which will significantly help developers.
      <p><b> Outcome of Project </p></b>
      If my project is successful it will become very beneficial for those who workout regularly, as well as those who
      intend to go on a diet where this app will help significantly in counting calories in a quick and efficient
      manner.
      Additionally, this app will erase the need to write down your daily intake including protein, carbohydrates, fats
      and total calories completely, allowing users to scan the barcode of food items saving time. Although there are
      many
      other calorie counting apps there are extremely limited apps that allow for users to scan the barcode of items
      some
      of the apps that do allow this have a limited food library. The development of this app will evolve calorie
      counting
      apps as a whole offering a large food library for users to scan food items.
